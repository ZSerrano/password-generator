## Description
Refactored the source code to generate a randomized password utilizing criteria specified by the user and of a length input by the user.


## Additions/Alterations
- Added arrays containing all potential characters in password
- Added empty arrays for validation methods and a counter set to 0
- Created a function called generatePassword to run through multiple statements and a validation function that would return a randomized password of specific criteria and length at the end
- Created an initial prompt for the user's length input and an if else if statement to validate the length input and ensure it's an integer between 8-128 characters long
- Created multiple confirm functions to set remaining criteria for password
- Created a validatePass function to ensure that the password consists of set criteria and contains at least one character from each specific element of criteria
- Created a for loop to randomize password and set up lines of code afterwards to join the password array together into a string with no separators that can then be returned
